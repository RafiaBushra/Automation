This is a simulation of a Heat Run Test for a 3-phase transformer. 

For a transformer to last long, its components need to be maintained properly. A key factor in the maintenance is the temperature. If the heat gets too high, individual components (such as the Copper/metalic coils, windings and oil) begin to decay. So, tests are conducted regularly to check that the temperature while the machine is running does not exceed its limits. 

We check the efficiency of the transformer with loss tests: Open Circuit and Short Circuit tests. These tests check the efficiency, voltage regulation and circuit constants of the transformer. The results of these tests give us the value of total loss and using this, we inject the transformer with the rated current. The circulation of this current makes the temperature in the winding rise. With time, the temperature in the fuel and winding reaches constant value. And this is the temperature we use to check whether the Heat Run Test would pass or fail. 

Generally, the upper limit is 60 degrees for the oil and 65 degrees for the winding. Any higher values than this, and the test fails. Meaning, the transformer is not durable.
